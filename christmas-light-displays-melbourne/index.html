Instead of chucking a Christmas wreath on the door and calling it a day, they meticulously decorate their homes with a vast array of <strong>bright lights, inflatables, rooftop decorations</strong> and more. After planning their display weeks in advance and decorating their homes, they spend the rest of the holiday season happy and satisfied, knowing that every child in the neighbourhood will stand in awe of their Christmas lights display.
