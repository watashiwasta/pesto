<p>At <strong>Le Petit Chef</strong>, your table is transformed into a screen, with entertaining performances from a virtual, tiny chef. As he tries to cook, he faces some amusing blunders, but thankfully, the kitchen staff in real life are there to assist before things get too out of hand. Check it out at The Langham Melbourne from Tuesday to Saturday at select times.</p>
