Heck, it&#8217;s our job, and sometimes we feel like we&#8217;re barely scratching the surface. Still, we love a challenge, and this time, we&#8217;ve set ourselves the goal of rounding up the <strong>essential experiences</strong> that Melbourne has to offer in one handy guide. It may take you a while to complete them, but we reckon these are the <em>crème de la crème</em>: <strong>the very best things to do in Melbourne</strong> at least once in your life. Go forth and explore, and make sure to save this list to keep up to date with the latest happenings.</p>

<p>Famously, Melbourne&#8217;s four-seasons-in-a-day climate means you&#8217;re never that far from rain, let&#8217;s be honest. At <strong>Rain Room</strong>, however, you&#8217;re not in danger of getting wet. Merging art, technology, and nature, the rainfall here responds to your presence, eliciting the feeling of being in a rainstorm without the sodden clothes. Find it in St Kilda from now until March 2024.</p>

<p>There are no ifs or buts: if you&#8217;re in Melbourne, you&#8217;ve got to get your hands on a croissant from <strong>Lune</strong>. Their pursuit of croissant perfection is near legendary, and their lovingly laminated creations have delighted foodies from around the world for over ten years now. The classic croissant is the proof of their labour of love, but ever-inventive variations will have you coming back time and time again. You&#8217;ll find their bakeries in Armadale, Fitzroy, and on Collins Street in the CBD.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a simple idea: to survive the winter, you need fire. And if that fire looks pretty, can be twirled, or can be turned into sculptures, all the better. <strong>Firelight Festival</strong> will return in 2024 to illuminate the winter solstice, and entry to this Docklands festival is entirely free.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy a unique new dining experience, as Gingerboy invites you to enjoy a three course meal in complete darkness. The theory is that with the sense of sight eliminated, you’ll focus solely on taste, smell and touch. This will allow the flavours of each dish in front of you to be intensified, while also adding a little mystery to the dining experience. Have fun figuring out what each meal consists of, and enjoy a new way of experiencing flavours. <a

<p>A multi-million-dollar renovation brought Melbourne&#8217;s oldest public boathouse into the 21st century, and boy is it looking swish. There&#8217;s heaps of space for indoor and outdoor dining, and there&#8217;s now an onsite pizzeria serving wood-fired pizzas as you gaze across a tranquil stretch of the <strong>Yarra</strong>. Of course, you&#8217;d be remiss not to hire a boat while you&#8217;re there, especially when dogs are welcome to come along too!</p>

<p>St Kilda has long been regarded as Melbourne&#8217;s summer playground, and perhaps no site has contributed more to that reputation than <strong>Luna Park</strong>. The historic amusement park has been a beloved fixture of the bayside suburb since opening its mouth in 1912, making its iconic wooden rollercoaster, officially known as <strong>The Great Scenic Railway</strong>, the second-oldest operating rollercoaster in the world and one of only seven anywhere that requires a brakeman to stand on the train. Despite its age, carriages on the 967-metre-long track can hurtle along at up to 60km/h, making for a thrilling ride backed by one of the best views in town.</p>

It&#8217;s still one of the best this side of Athens, thanks to the perfectly seasoned, melt-in-the-mouth meat cut to order from the rotisserie. Opt for a serving of crunchy chips inside your wrap for a truly authentic experience.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that we live in a great walking city, but Melbourne simply isn&#8217;t Melbourne without the ding and rattle of its iconic <strong>tram network</strong> that stretches in just about every which direction from the city. The CBD&#8217;s free tram zone is a must if you&#8217;re showing visitors around – or if you just want to feel like a tourist in your own city.</p>

<p>Established in 1854 as the Melbourne Public Library, Swanston Street&#8217;s <strong>State Library</strong> is not only Australia&#8217;s oldest public library and one of the world&#8217;s first free libraries, but, as of 2023, is also the third busiest library anywhere in the world. That last stat shouldn&#8217;t come as too much of a surprise — after all, the 170-year-old building boasts a fascinating collection of around 5 million items, which includes books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, newspapers and paintings, as well as historical artefacts like <strong>Ned Kelly&#8217;s armour</strong>. The SLV also has a stacked, year-round exhibitions and events calendar, ensuring there&#8217;s always something different to see with every visit.</p>
